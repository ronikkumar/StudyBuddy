# StudyBuddy
StudyBuddy is a web application that facilitates finding study partners. StudyBuddy will allow users to make and view postings for study groups. Users will be able to search for others currently studying the same material around them. They will then be able to join a chat to arrange the logistics of an in-person meetup.
